    <p>There are two ways to cancel your subscription to a Gumroad membership:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>From your receipt</li>
      <li>From your library (if you have a Gumroad account)</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Cancellation will not lead to an automatic refund. Cancelling a subscription merely means you will no longer be charged future payments. You still need to <a href="190-how-do-i-get-a-refund.html">ask the creator of the product for a refund</a>, should you need one.</p>
    <p><b>Note: </b>Deleting your account will automatically cancel all memberships you are currently subscribed to.</p>
    <h3>From your receipt</h3>
    <p>Go to your latest charge receipt and click "Subscription settings" or "Manage membership":</p>

    <h3>From your Library</h3>
    <p>It's likely that when you first purchased this subscription product, you created a Gumroad account. The account you created will be under the email address where you are receiving Gumroad receipts.</p>
    <ol>
      <li><a href="https://app.gumroad.com/login/">Login</a> to your account.</li>
      <li>Go to your <a href="https://app.gumroad.com/library">Gumroad Library</a>.</li>
      <li>Click on the membership you wish to cancel.</li>
      <li>Click "Manage membership" and then the “Cancel membership” button.</li>
    </ol>
