    <p>We want Gumroad to be a platform that makes it possible for creatives to make a living from doing what they love. You can help us keep the Gumroad community safe by selling only your original creations and keeping it legal. And be respectful — this is not a platform for targeted harassment or violence. </p>
    <h3>What is not allowed on Gumroad?</h3>
    <p>We can all play a part in making our community safe for everyone by speaking up when we see something that violates Gumroad’s values.

      <li>Threatens harm to or discloses private information about an individual;</li>
      <li>Is not their own work (this includes plagiarism and selling used goods);</li>
      <li>Violates the federal law of the US;</li>
