    <h3 id="what-is-gumroad-community">What is Gumroad Community?</h3>
    <p>Gumroad Community is a free feature that allows you to create dedicated chat spaces for your products. By enabling Community, you can foster direct communication with your customers, answer questions, share updates, and build a community of users around your offerings.</p>
    <p>Communities are product-specific, giving your customers a space to connect not just with you but with each other, enhancing the value of your products and reducing churn through increased engagement.</p>
    <h3 id="enabling-community-for-your-product">Enabling Community for your product</h3>
    <p>To enable the Community feature for one of your products:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Go to your product's edit page</li>

      <li>Switch the toggle ON and save the changes</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Once enabled, a new "Community" link will appear in the main sidebar, and customers who purchase this product will gain access to its community.</p>
